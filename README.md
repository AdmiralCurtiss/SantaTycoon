In *Santa Tycoon*, you play Santa and have to produce gifts and gift them to kids while managing your resources and elves.

Some tips on how to play:
* Each Elf costs you *1 Money per day*. Hiring a new Elf also costs 1 Money, but *they won't be Free until the next day*.
* Only *Free Elves* are available for actions. Actions you can do with them:
  * Assigning Elves to Resources produces some resources of that type each day. Elves stay assigned to a resource until you unassign them; once you do, you have to wait a day for them to be Free again.
  * Most Gifts you produce require some Elves to work on. This is temporary, Elves working on a present will be Free again the next day.
* Resources other than Elves are just spent when you use them on a present.
* Advancing to the next day produces resources, refreshes all unassigned Elves, and pays 1 Money to all Elves.
* To get more money, you need to gift your presents. To do so, press the "Give a Present" button, then select a present to give to the person that appears.
  * The better the present fits the person's personality, the more money you get!
* Occasionally, random events occur when advancing a day. Watch out!
